# Wizard Search ( TDF-IDF search engine)

Is a simple search engine based on a previous project [Experimenting_with_TF-IDF](https://github.com/tartaruz/Experimenting_with_TF-IDF) to show how the theory behind TF-IDF works. Explanation about how it works can be found in the olâ€™ project.

# Usage 
> As a retro search engine, just search for what you want! The only limit is your imagination......is the size of the engine :(

The files are copies of Wikipedia with different content. The most relevant for you after pressing search will appear as a list of bottom under the search bar. By clicking on them, you will be navigated to its page

The topics/pages listed in the engine:
- Bread
- Clouds
- Hot Dog
- Norway
- Rainbow
- Sun
- TV
